# AnyCubic-Kossel-Linear-Plus-Marlin-2.0.x-upgrade
A marlin firmware for upgrade my AnyCubic Kossel Linear Plus Marlin 2.0.x
I've broken my original probe so now I'm using a piezo-electric smart effector as the probe.
The On-off state of piezo-electric smart effector is NO(Normally Open),but the original probe is NC.
So I set the Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING as true.
